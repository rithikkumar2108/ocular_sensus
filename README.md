For visually impaired individuals, everyday life is filled with challenges that most people never have to think about. Finding misplaced objects, moving safely through unfamiliar spaces, and seeking help in emergencies can be daunting without reliable assistance.
Traditional methods like canes or verbal guidance from others often fall short in providing complete independence. Without real-time awareness of their surroundings, individuals face obstacles, disorientation, and potential safety risks. In emergencies, quickly notifying others and getting assistance becomes even more difficult, increasing vulnerability.
A solution is neededâ€”one that enhances mobility, safety, and independence, allowing visually impaired individuals to navigate the world with confidence.
