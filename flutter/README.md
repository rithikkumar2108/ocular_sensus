# Ocular Sensus App


Certain files are intentionally .gitignored for security and privacy reasons, as they contain personal or sensitive information such as API keys or credentials. These include:

    firebase_options.dart – Contains Firebase configuration and API keys

    google-services.json – Firebase Android config file

    local.properties – Android-specific local settings (e.g., SDK path)

You won’t find these files in the repository, but you can still explore and use the app with your own Firebase project setup.

### Source Code

    The Flutter app’s main source code (UI, logic, and pages) is located in the /lib directory.

    All Flutter dependencies used in the project are listed in pubspec.yaml.
